Every day I get few emails with job offers from recruiters. Some of them are ok but most of them are completely irrelevant. For instance, today I received an offer for Head of Clinical Oncology Programme and as much as I appreciate it, I'm not sure my experience in PHP, Glang and couple of other languages would be enough for them. Most of those emails are sent by an automated systems. I know that because I tend to get emails which start from "Hello {FIRST_NAME}". Generally getting those emails is ok if you are looking for a job but if not, you can end up having a lot of irrelevant spam your inbox. 

This is why I started writing down all the recruitment company domains so I could add them to filter. Now I have one folder for them and it's nice to see my inbox clean and tidy while I'm on a lengthy contract.

You can grab the list from here: https://gist.github.com/majest/7004390

It's far from completion but gives a good coverage in London. Comments welcomed.
