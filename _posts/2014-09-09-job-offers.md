Every day I get few emails with job offers from recruiters. 
Some of them are ok but most of them are completely irrelevant. For instance, today I received an offer for Head of Clinial 
Oncology Programme and as much as I appreciate it, I'm not sure my experience in PHP, Goland and couple of other languages would be enough for them.
Most of those emails are sent by an automated systems. I know that because I tend to get emails which start from "Hello {FIRST_NAME}".
Generally it's ok but after a while, if you don't keep your inbox clean you will end up having lots of emails in your inbox and it's
fine if you are looking for something but if not...

This is why I started writing down all the recruitment company domains so I could add them to filter. 
Now I have one folder for them and it's nice to see my inbox clean and tidy while I'm on a lengthy contract. 

You can grab the list from here: [https://gist.github.com/majest/7004390]

It's far from completion but gives a good coverage in London.
