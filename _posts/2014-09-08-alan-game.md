Two feeks ago I needed a break and I decided to write a game. Initially the idea was to write a 3d space sim game, well at least a prototype. I started with [Three.js][threejs] but it wasn't very easy to use and I had to dig up through the documentation to do any progress. My first threejs prototype is available [here][alantjs]. It can load a 3d model and it displays something similar to stars. 

Then I found [Phaser.io][phaser] which had one of the [examples][example] looking like exactly what I need. Starting from here my aim was to make the game multiplayer but I wasn't really sure how to do it apart from that I knew it has to be done using sockets. I've managed to find [this example at ezelia.com][tankmulti] which makes the tank example a multiplayer game.

My first prototype is available here: [https://github.com/majest/alan-game][alan] and it's far from finished. One bug is that background is not moved correctly when second player joins. Another issue I have to onvestigate is the network synchronisation between players. Sending the coordinates every few seconds or on action is not enough to keep both player positions in sync. If anyone has an idea how to do it please contact me. I appreciate all help.
