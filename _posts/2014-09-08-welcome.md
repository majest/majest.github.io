Few days ago I was looking for a nice solution which would allow me to create a blog, fast and easy. My first thought was to set up a Wordpress blog on my server but then I though, there must be an easier way.. there is. Github is one place where you can do it and it allows you to create a new repository in "username.github.io" format at which you can access your content. Additionally you can use github's Automatic Page Generator available in settings which will help you to do that. Alternatively you can use Jekyll which is available at [http://jekyllrb.com][jekyllrb]{:target="_blank"}. It's a nice and easy way to generate static content. This blog is created using jekyl and available at my [github profile][majest]{:target="_blank"}
