To improve the security standards all passwords, pem files, keys and other sensitive data can be encrypted using GPG. Itâ€™s generally not advised to send such data using open text via Skype, E-mail etc.

You should start by creating a key pair which will create an entry in your keychain. This command will generate key pair which is a secret and public key. Keep your secret key secure. Send your public key to a person you will be receiving the encrypted data from. 

$>gpg --gen-key


To recieve encrypted messages it's required to export a public key. This key then needs to be sent to sender who will be encrypting the message

$>gpg --export -a ag@pb.com > your_name-public.gpg


Usually encrypted messages are delivered as gpg or asc file where gpg files are delivered as binary and asc files are in plain text. To decrypt a message:

$>gpg -d encrypted_file
